Dipnet_App! is an attempt to bring the public more data to make a decisions when to go dipnetting at the Kenai River entrance. The data is made available from various sources.  The <a href="https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/sf/FishCounts/index.cfm?ADFG=main.displayResults&COUNTLOCATIONID=40&SpeciesID=420" target="_blank">sonar data</a> and <a href="http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareauci.salmon#/research" target="_blank">test fishery</a> data are available from ADFG. The <a href="http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=TWC1983" target="_blank">tide data</a> is available from NOAA as an annual schedule. Please consider the return distribution, tide cycle, the Cook Inlet test fishery (which can predict large surges), historic trends of the sonar count distributions, and <a href="http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=cfnews_mobile.search_results&mgmt=3&spec=14&gear=1&act=" target="_blank">personal use fishery news</a> and <a href="http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareauci.salmon#/fishery" target="_blank" >commerical gillnet and set net news for the Cook Inlet</a> as close to when you leave for the river as you can. 

This app was a project of <a href="http://codeforanchorage.org/" target="_blank" >Code for Anchorage</a> and the spring 2014 hAKathon.
